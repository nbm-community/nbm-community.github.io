Download   Download here   Using .bat file:   nbminer -a algo -o protocol+socket_type://pool_host:pool_port -u wallet_address.worker:passwd   LHR unlock options      --lhr &lt;modes&gt; - partial unlock hashrate for Nvidia LHR GPUs.   Available Values: [-1, 100]. 0: auto, -1: off.   Notice: set to 80 means tryiung to reach 80% of nonlocked max hashrate.   Example LHR mode for ETH with ethermine:   nbminer -a ethash -o eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4.rig --lhr 80  pause   &nbsp;      --lhr-mode, --lm &lt;modes&gt;  -  LHR unlock mode for Nvidia LHR GPUs.   Available Values: 1 or 2.  1: higher max hashrate, higher power consumption;  2: lower max hashrate, lower average power consumption.   Example:   nbminer -a ethash -o eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4.rig --lhr-mode 1  pause  &nbsp;           --lhr-reduce-value, --lrv &lt;value&gt; - The amount of -lhr valud reduced each time when GPU hits LHR lock.            --lhr-reduce-time, --lrt &lt;time&gt;  -  The -lhr value will reduce by -lhr-reduce-value if the time since last lock.            --lhr-reduce-limit, --lrl &lt;limit&gt; - Limit the times of -lhr been reduced.       Fee      --fee &lt;fee&gt;    Change devfee in percentage, [0-5]. Set to 0 to turn off devfee with lower hashrate. Otherwise, devfee = max(set_value, default_value).   Overclock settings   Just add this parameters to the command in the .bat file you use (with the desired core clock speed - 1075-1150 work well for a RTX 3070)   It differs from your current clock as in it is dynamic and adjusted to hit the power limit you set. If you lock the core clock, it will only draw as much power needed to reach the desired core clock. For most users this results in a decrease in power draw of about 5-10W.   Power Limit      --power-limit, --pl &lt;limit&gt; - Set power limit of GPU.   Set PL in watts: --pl 200.   nbminer -a ethash -o eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4.rig --pl 200  pause  &nbsp;   In the characteristics of the video card, you can see its declared power consumption. GPU power consumption is indicated in Watts. The higher the TDP, the more power is consumed by the graphics adapter in full load.   Read the guide to setting up MSI Afterburner - power limit, monitoring, core voltage on Windows.   Set PL in percetage of default PowerLimit: --pl 75%   nbminer -a ethash -o eu1.ethermine.org:4444 -u 0x3aa3e06C47caDEf96202D378aB7C407CF46A36A4.rig --pl 75%  pause  &nbsp;   Absolute core clock and lock core clock      --cclock &lt;clocks&gt; - Set core clock in MHz.            Set clock offsets: --cclock 100, --cclock -500 (Windows only)       Set locked clock: --cclock @1500.           --mclock &lt;clocks&gt; - Set memory clock offsets in MHz. (Windows only)   Instead of using an offset clock and power limit (you can still apply a power limit), you can lock the Core Clock and the GPU will only draw the power needed.   Windows:   --lock-cv 1075 (you gotta fiddle around a little bit).       --lock-cv &lt;cv&gt; - Set locked core voltages in mV. (Windows only)   You got to run .bat file as Administrator.   Linux:  If you are using linux you can also use:   nvidia-smi -i 0 -lgc 1075 (where 0 is your GPU ID)   Ravos:   nvidia-smi -lgc 1050 - Change number to supported core lock range   Memory tweak      --mt, --memory-tweak &lt;mode&gt;  -  Memory timings optimize for Nvidia GDDR5 &amp; GDDR5X gpus.   Available range [1-6]. Higher value equals higher hashrate.   Individual value can be set via comma seperated list. Power limit may need to be tuned up to get more hashrate.   Higher reject share ratio can happen if mining rig hits high temperature, set lower value of -mt can reduce reject ratio.   Driver install   Under windows, a custom driver need to be installed when using -mt, can installed manually by option  --driver, or run nbminer.exe with admin privilege to perform auto-install.   Under linux, admin priviledge is needed to run, sudo ./nbminer -mt x.   OhGodAnETHlargementPill is not needed anymore if -mt is enabled when mining on 1080 &amp; 1080ti GPUs.      --driver &lt;action&gt; -   Windows only option, install / uninstall driver for memory tweak. Run with admin priviledge.        install: nbminer.exe --driver install,   uninstall: nbminer.exe --driver uninstall.   Fan      --fan &lt;speed&gt; - Set GPU fan speed in percentage.

(Windows only)                        feature: Display current LHR value in console summary table and web monitor.            feature: -proxy options now support username &amp; password for SOCKS5 proxy. format: -proxy user:pass@host:port            feature: Web monitor changes, delete unused information for dual mining.            feature: new options for log control.              -log-no-job: Turn off the New job line in console.       -log-cycle: Set to change the cycle of Summary table show in console and log, in seconds, defaults to 30.                fix: ethash Change CPU share validation to independent thread, lower performance degradation when mining at very low difficulty pools.            fix: LHR lock detected failure on some cases.       v39.7(2021-10-30)      feature: LHR mode support new GA104 version of 3060   feature: ethash Turn on LHR mode by default for 3060 v1, disabled by default only on windows 470.05   fix: ethash Fail to detect LHR lock on certain situation.   fix: Nvidia GPU power consumption issue on certain rig config.   delete: support for sero.   v39.6(2021-10-27)      optimize:ethash LHR mode significant improvement:            higher hashrate, more stable LHR unlocking for both -lhr-mode 1 and -lhr-mode 2       default LHR mode changes to -lhr-mode 1 for LHR GPUs       default values of LHR mode increased, -lhr-mode 1 -&gt; 74, -lhr-mode 2 -&gt; 71       added 3 new options for LHR auto-tuning control, at most cases you don’t need to change:                    -lhr-reduce-value: the amount to reduce -lhr value on a single -lhr tuning. defaults to 0.5.           -lhr-reduce-time: When LHR lock is detected, and the time since the last lock exceeds this value, the -lhr reduce will not perform. defaults to 15, which means 15 minutes.           -lhr-reduce-limit: the maximum number of times to reduce -lhr value, defaults to 6.                       Typical hashrate: 3060Ti LHR on defaults options, 45.5 MH/s @ mem+1200 (win10)           feature: ergo also adapts the 3 new LHR options.   feature: add -cmd-output option to specify command line outpu to stdout or stderr, 1=stdout, 2=stderr, defaults to 2.   feature: disable SNI extension for ssl connections by default, can be enabled with -enable-sni option   delete: cuckatoo &amp; cuckatoo32 support   v39.5(2021-09-24)      feature: ergo new LHR mode for mining ERGO, enable it by manually adding -lhr option            Same as LHR mode in ethash, -lhr value represents expected hashrate to reach value percent of non-LHR GPU’s hashrate, supports comma-seperated list to indicate -lhr value for each GPU, and -lhr -1 to disable.       For GPUs with Hynix GDDR6 memory, LHR mode is not recommended for the poor performance.       For GPUs with non-Hynix GDDR6 memory, e.g. 3060 3060ti 3070, start trying with -lhr 85       For GPUs with GDDR6X memory, e.g. 3070ti 3080 3080ti, start trying with -lhr 100       When mining lock is detected during ERGO mining, miner will automatically decrease -lhr value by 0.5, and continue mining. max decrease times is 10, which sums to 5.0           optimize: ergo Lower power consumption on Nvidia GPUs.   v39.4(2021-09-21)      fix: octopus Fix error hash issue.   v39.3(2021-09-18)      feature: ethash new low power LHR mode, add -lhr-mode option.            -lhr-mode 2 is the default LHR mode, which is the new lower power mode.       -lhr-mode 1 changes LHR mode to old version, which is the same as v39.2       -lhr-mode 1 is suitable for only power limit bounded GPU, can achieve higher hashrate than mode 2       -lhr-mode 2 is able to achieve lower average power and temperature. espacially suitable for GPUs with gddr6x e.g.3070ti, 3080, 3080ti. Power consumtion is fluctuating in this mode, better be used with locked core clock.           feature: -lhr support decimal value   feature: for LHR GPUs, when mining lock is detected, miner will automatically decrease -lhr value by 0.1, and continue mining. max decrease times is 10, which sums to 1.0   fix: higher CPU usage when set --share-check 0   v39.2(2021-09-01)      feature: ethash added LHR lock detection and recovery in LHR mode.   feature: added memory temperature display  (if available) for Nvidia and AMD GPU under windows.   fix: ergo more robust protocol handle.   Note: LHR mode requires NVML library to work, please make sure the driver is installed properly and do not add -no-health argument.   v39.1(2021-08-21)      optimize: ethash improve hashrate of LHR mode 1 - 2%，default value of -lhrchanges from 68 to 69，manually set to 70 is also very promising.   fix: LHR mode support on windows driver 471.11   fix: kawpow issue of v39.0   fix: Radeon vii issue on windows driver 21.6.1+   v39.0(2021-08-15)      feature: ethash New LHR mode for ETH mining on RTX 30 series LHR GPUs, supports Windows &amp; Linux, able to get ~70% of maximum unlocked hashrate.            This mode can be tuned by argument -lhr, only works for ethash right now.       -lhr default to 0, meaning even if -lhr is not set, LHR mode with -lhr 68 will be applied to LHR GPUs if certain GPUs are detected.       Tune LHR mode by setting -lhr &lt;value&gt;, a specific value will tell miner try to reach value percent of maximum unlocker hashrate, e.g. -lhr 68 will expect to get 68% of hashrate for same model non-LHR GPU.       Higher -lhr value will results in higher hashrate, but has higher possibility to run into lock state, which will leads to much less hashrate.       A good start tuning value is 68, which has been tested to be stable on most rig configurations.       -lhr value can be set for each GPU by using comma separeted list, -lhr 65,68,0,-1, where -1 means turn off LHR mode.           v38.2(2021-07-27)      fix: AMD kernel error on certain GPUs with 21.6.1+ drivers under windows.   v38.1(2021-06-29)      fix: high CPU usage in v38.0   v38.0(2021-06-29)      feature: ergo add mining.extranonce.subscribe support.   fix: eliminate memory leak by NVML library for Nvidia driver 460+ on windows.   fix: --enable-dag-cache causes crash on certain situation.   v37.6(2021-06-03)      fix: ethash --enable-dag-cache cause crash on AMD GPUs when switch DAG file.   fix: ergo support on AMD Vega GPUs.   v37.5(2021-05-21)   changes from 37.3      new algo: ergo for AMD GPU, can be faster with ETH mining timings   optimize: ergo slightly improce hashrate on Nvidia GPUs   feature: use --temperature-limit &amp;

Changelog   Ethash New LHR mode for ETH mining on RTX 30 series LHR GPUs, able to get ~70% of maximum unlocked hashrate.     This mode can be tuned by argument -lhr, only works for ethash right now.   -lhr default to 0, meaning even if -lhr is not set, LHR mode with -lhr 68 will be applied to LHR GPUs if certain GPUs are detected.   Tune LHR mode by setting -lhr &lt;value&gt;, a specific value will tell miner try to reach value percent of maximum unlocker hashrate, e.g. -lhr 68 will expect to get 68% of hashrate for same model non-lhr GPU. Higher -lhr value will results in higher hashrate, but has higher possibility to run into lock state, which will leads to much less hashrate. A good start tuning value is 68, which has been tested to be stable on most rig configurations.   -lhr value can be set for each GPU by using comma separeted list, -lhr 65,68,0,-1, where -1 means turn off LHR mode.

ETH hashrate for 3060,3060 Ti,3070,3070 Ti,3080,3080 Ti  In this video I test the new 100% LHR unlock for mining Ethereum at full hashrate on LHR GPUs. The full hashrate unlock for LHR cards was first introduced in Nicehash on Saturday and has now come to the latest version of NBminer as well. This new 100% LHR unlock is possible with NBminer, which lets you mine at full hashrate on LHR graphics cards, just like in Nicehash. I test it on all LHR GPUs, including the RTX 3060 LHR, 3060 Ti LHR and 3070 LHR, to see what hashrate, overclock settings and profits we can get. I show you how to download and set up the NBminer in both Windows and HiveOS to mine Ethereum with the 100% LHR unlocker. I then go through overclock settings and hashrates for all LHR GPUs, including the RTX 3070 Ti, 3080 LHR and 3080 Ti. After watching this video I hope you will have learned how to unlock LHR 100% for mining Ethereum at full hashrate with NBminer.        ","categories": ["download"],
